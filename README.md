# ZOOTLAB
ZOOTLAB is a Unity suite for creating and simulating Arknights maps. Currently, only enemies are simulated but it is planned for operators to be implemented in the future.

ZOOTLAB is a fan-made, unofficial hobby project for Arknights. This is not affiliated with Hypergryph or Yostar.

## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3.29f1. Newer versions may be compatible, but it remains untested
- Blender or any 3D modeling software that can work with *.fbx files
- A program (that supports LZHAM decompression) to unpack *.dat or *.ab files if necessary
  - Arkpacker: https://github.com/isHarryh/Ark-Unpacker
  - AssetStudioGUI (Arknights Modification): https://github.com/aelurum/AssetStudio/releases/tag/ak-v1.2.3
